Create random stories called "pages" with choices and consequences about AIDS. Order the choices to be for or against the fight against AIDS.
Each "page" has multiple options to take, given by GPT-3. At least two options have to be provided, ideally three.
Each option will redirect the player to a new "page" with a new story element and new options.
The options can potentially redirect to another page.
The "pages" will be numbered.

The format is the following (replace text between "*" by the corresponding value)
Format:
```json
{
number: *page number*,
story: *generated story between quotes*,
option1: {
desc: *option description between quotes*,
positive: *whether the option is useful for the fight against AIDS (true/false)*,
redirects: *number of the page it redirects to*,
},
option12 {
desc: *option description between quotes*,
positive: *whether the option is useful for the fight against AIDS (true/false)*,
redirects: *number of the page it redirects to*
}},
```

Give "pages" 1 to 32 from the description above with their different options in JSON.
