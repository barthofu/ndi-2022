Create random stories called "pages" with choices and consequences about AIDS. Order the choices to be for or against the fight against AIDS.
Each "page" has multiple options to take, given by GPT-3. At least two options have to be provided, ideally three.
Each option will redirect the player to a new "page" with a new story element and new options.
The options can potentially redirect to another page.
The "pages" will be numbered.

Format: ```
---Page [page number]---
Story: [generated story]
Option 1:
Desc: [option description]
Positive: [whether the option is useful for the fight against AIDS (YES/NO)]
Redirects: [number of the page it redirects to]
Option 2:
Desc: [option description]
Positive: [whether the option is useful for the fight against AIDS (YES/NO)]
Redirects: [number of the page it redirects to]
---[page number]!---
```

Give 10 "pages" from the description above with their different options.
